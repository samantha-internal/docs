# API design

## Design goals

Desired attributes for the APIs:

| Attribute | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Accuracy** | Models should have the ability to run transparent accuracy benchmarks on demand |
| **Composable** | APIs should allow composing them together in different combinations |
| **Context-aware** | APIs should have access to context and conversation history |
| **Trainable** | All models should have trainable pipelines |
| **Multilingual** | Models should have support for multiple languages \(may be released over time\) |
| **Modern** | Built on modern, type-safe protocols like GraphQL |
