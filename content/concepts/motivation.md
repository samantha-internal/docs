## Our mission

We envision a world in which humans can talk to computers as fluently as they would with, say, a neighbor. Our mission is to make computing more human and accessible for everyone.

## Why we built Whitehead AI

In the near future, voice will become an important mode of human-computer interaction at par with the visual and tactile UIs \(cellphones, laptops, etc.\) of today. Billions of experiences are going to use voice, both standalone and in conjunction with other modes of interactions. For this to happen, we are going to need tools and infrastructure that can capture and handle the nuances of human speech. However, the existing tools for creating these experiences are nascent and akin to what browsers and operating systems were to visual UIs 20 years ago.

We are building those tools so that we can make that future a reality.
