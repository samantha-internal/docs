# GraphQL playground

## Explore APIs using the built-in GraphiQL console

We have embedded an interactive GraphiQL interface within [the dashboard](https://console.whitehead.ai) itself. Just login and navigate to the [GraphiQL Playground](https://console.whitehead.ai/graphiql) from the nav menu on the left.

On clicking it, you will be taken to a fully-featured GraphiQL IDE with the correct session tokens needed to access the API.
