The SDK ships with a _CUI_ playground for interactively trying out APIs. It includes basic documentation, autocomplete and a preconfigured async environment. Install the npm package `@whitehead/playground`, then you can simply call the binary shipped along with it.

```bash
npm install -g @whitehead/playground
whitehead-playground

# Or,
npx @whitehead/playground
```
