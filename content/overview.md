# Overview

## What we offer

The existing API offerings are low-level and require knowledge of NLP and training deep learning models. We have built a suite of APIs that tackle high-level tasks and are ready to use with or without custom training data.

Whitehead provides accurate, trainable, and context-aware natural language APIs that are tastefully designed to be simple to use.

## Target Audience

* Developers and startups building natural language and voice applications.
* Research institutes and media labs looking for more powerful NL tools.
* Consulting firms looking for a NL solution that gives them an edge in product shipping.
* Enterprise companies interested in building competitors to Alexa, Google Assistant, and Siri.
