# Use Cases 

The scope of natural language understanding in facilitating better Human-Computer interactions is really vast. At Whitehead, we believe that we are at the threshold of a future where we will be able to talk to computers as fluently as we do with another person. With Whitehead APIs, you can create natural-sounding, context-aware, and intelligent interfaces. This can be extremely useful for many different industries. Some of the broad categories are as follows:

## Virtual concierge

These are companies looking to build stand-alone virtual assistants/concierges  such as Siri, Google Assistant that help you in your daily tasks and queries and enhance your productivity. 

## Commerce

Whitehead enables voice based commerce through simple bots that can take  orders or process transactions in a seamless way. These are companies like Doordash for food ordering, Instacart for Grocery Shopping, Expedia for Travel Booking etc.

## Intelligent business automation

These are companies looking to automate part of their business flow such as Customer Support and other Internal Operations. This is a very interesting and  important theme of the day and is worth exploring deeper. 

## Voice-first UIs

This is the category we are most excited about in the long term. Just like Mobile first companies gained an edge over their web compatriots, we believe that Voice first companies would gain an edge in terms of end user experience with respect to  the companies adhering to the current modes of interaction with computing  devices. These companies would usher a new era of Human Computer Interaction  unlocking new experiences and use cases unimaginable before. 

## Hands-free environments

Environments where the ergonomics do not allow the use of hands would use Voice to interact with the technology. Some examples are warehousing, driving, surgery etc. 

## Gaming and entertainment

In the gaming and entertainment industry, avatars are currently created using na√Øve rule-based algorithms. With our API, these companies can create human-like, natural-sounding Avatars that can interact with the gamer or viewer in an intelligent manner. 

## Embedded systems

A hardware company looking to make a device to compete with Amazon Echo or Google Home, or simply build Voice Enabled Kiosks or Embedded Systems with  an Intelligent Conversant AI can use our SDK to enable such experiences. 

## Augmented / Virtual reality

AR is a perfect application of better speech interfaces. They usually involve complete or partial occupation of hands and vision. Using speech interactions can both increase dexterity and enhance the immersion.

## Productivity

Taking notes during meetings and turning them into structured, actionable data.
